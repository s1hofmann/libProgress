# libProgress
A little progressbar utility written in C++

I'm writing a lot of computer vision applications which run on the command line.

Ever since, I missed a way to easily draw progress bars to visualize current progress, so I decided to write my own little utility.


main.cpp contains a little example to show basic useage.
